Healthy Breaks: Privacy-First Health Reminders

Sitting at your computer all day? Your body is paying the price. Healthy Breaks helps you build sustainable wellness habits with smart, gentle reminders that keep you healthy without disrupting your workflow.

🎯 WHAT IT DOES

Healthy Breaks is a privacy-first Chrome extension that reminds you to take essential health breaks throughout your workday. Unlike intrusive apps that demand immediate attention, our smart notification system respects your flow while keeping your health on track.

We cover all aspects of desk work wellness:

👁️ EYE BREAKS - Combat digital eye strain
The 20-20-20 rule in action: Every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Reduce headaches, dry eyes, and fatigue from prolonged screen time.

💧 WATER BREAKS - Stay hydrated effortlessly
Regular hydration reminders that keep your energy up and your mind sharp. No more afternoon slumps from dehydration.

🚶 MOVEMENT BREAKS - Fight the sitting disease
Stand up, stretch, and walk around. Combat the harmful effects of prolonged sitting with gentle movement prompts.

🧘 POSTURE CHECKS - Protect your spine
Subtle reminders to realign your posture, preventing neck pain, backaches, and long-term musculoskeletal issues.

✋ HAND & WRIST CARE - Prevent RSI
Stretch fingers and flex wrists to avoid repetitive strain injuries, carpal tunnel, and hand fatigue from typing.

🧠 MENTAL RESETS - Clear your mind
Short breaks to disengage, reducing stress and preventing burnout. Step away and return refreshed.

🫁 DEEP BREATHING - Instant stress relief
Guided breathing exercises to lower cortisol, increase oxygen, and calm your nervous system in just 60 seconds.

✨ WHY USERS LOVE HEALTHY BREAKS

🔒 COMPLETE PRIVACY
Zero data collection. Zero tracking. Zero external servers. All your data stays on your device using Chrome's secure local storage. We literally cannot see your information—even if we wanted to.

📱 BEAUTIFUL iOS-STYLE DESIGN
Modern, clean interface with smooth animations and satisfying toggle switches. It feels like a native app, not a clunky browser extension.

⚡ WORKS OFFLINE
No internet? No problem. All fonts, icons, and assets are bundled locally. Works on airplanes, in coffee shops with bad WiFi, or anywhere you go.

🎯 SMART, RESPECTFUL REMINDERS
Notifications appear when it's time for a break, but you control when to take them. Snooze for 5 minutes, mark as done, or pause all breaks during meetings.

🎨 FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE
Set custom intervals for each break type. Need eye breaks every 15 minutes instead of 20? Want water reminders every 45 minutes? You decide what works for your body and schedule.

🕐 ACCURATE TIMING
Uses Chrome's native alarm system to ensure reminders fire precisely when scheduled—even if you close the popup. Your breaks won't be forgotten.

🔄 EASY MASTER CONTROLS
One-click buttons to reset, snooze, or pause all breaks at once. Perfect for meetings, calls, or deep work sessions.

💚 NO CLUTTER, NO DISTRACTIONS
Minimalist design with hidden scrollbars and clean cards. Focus on your health, not fighting with the interface.
